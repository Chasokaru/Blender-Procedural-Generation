# Blender-Procedural-Generation

This is a script in workings that will allow users to help generate star systems in their blender enviroment, with customization

Use the Add_On version of the file with caution as currently its much more buggy and less optimized than the script version.
To use script version paste it into the Blender scripting tab, then press run script, got back to "Layout" tab,now on side menu u should see Planet Tools, 
before it go to view and set End distance to very big value (if u will generate big value orbits) and then go to planetTool
